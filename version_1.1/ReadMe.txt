Release date:	Jul. 15th, 2017

Version:	Version 1.1

Software:	This program is deponded on the following softwares, bowtie ("http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/index.shtml"), bowtie2 ("http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/index.shtml"), Stacks ("http://catchenlab.life.illinois.edu/stacks"), CAP3 ("http://seq.cs.iastate.edu/cap3.html") and blat ("https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~kent/src"). Please make sure they have been installed and avaliable in your directory.

Preparation:	1. Put a single reference chloroplast genome (fa format) in the folder of RefFile.
		2. Put all the PE-end RAD-Seq (fq format) in the folder of FastqFile. Read1 (next to restriction site) should be named as $sample_1.fq, the other one as $sample_2.fq, e.g.: CZYX01-2_1.fq, CZYX01-2_2.fq.

Usage:	nohup sh SACRing.sh $Ref $3'cohesive_end $Overlap_of_paired_tags $Read1_len $Read2_len $ThreadNumber >$Log 2>&1 &
		$Ref: File of Reference cp genome, including the path, e.g. RefFile/WHY01.fa.
		$3'cohesive_end: 3'end of restriction enzyme used in RAD-Seq, e.g. EcoR I (G'AATTC) was used in RAD-Seq, here print AATTC.
		$Overlap_of_paired_tags: It was counted as following formula: the length of restriction enzyme - (Enzyme cutting position) x 2, e.g. EcoR I (G'AATTC) was used in RAD-Seq, here print 4 (6 - 1 x 2 = 4).
		$Read1_len: the length of read1 in fastq file, e.g. 100.
		$Read2_len: the length of read2 in fastq file, e.g. 100.
		$ThreadNumber: Max Thread can be used in this analysis.
		$Log: Record of output on the screen.
	**E.g.: nohup sh SACRing.sh RefFile/WHY01.fa AATTC 4 100 100 20 >Log.txt 2>&1 &

Note:	Make sure that only three folders (RefFile, FastqFile and PerlScript) and three files (SACRing.sh, ReadMe, Pipeline.pdf) are existed in your work folder. Only the fq files which need to be analyzed exist in the folder of FastqFile, and only a fa file in RefFile.
	There are an example of Ref and fq files in the corresponding folders to test whether the software required are prepared, and this pipeline is OK for your Linux system. Please delete the example files before running of your own data.
	The fastq files with different length of read1/read2 pairs should be analyzed respectively. And all the read1 or read2 in a fastq file used in this pipeline should have uniform length.

Detail description of pipeline [pipeline.pdf]:
	Following quality control, paired-end RAD-Seq data was separated in different samples according to adapters (Fig. a). Individual RAD-seq profiles and the cp reference genome were 	stored in the folders of FastqFile and RefFile, respectively. Our pipeline was manually divided into four steps (Fig. b). Data preparation for Ref and fastq files were performed in Step 1. As for Ref, a non-redundant cp genome, excluding 2nd IR regions, were generated, after determination of the boundary of SC and IR regions. While for fastq files, a list was built to record the sample name. Step 2 was used to extract the cp-related data from PE RAD-Seq based on mapping results. Step 3, the core progress, was used to basic cluster and assembly. As illustrated at top half of Fig. b, during the construction of RAD library, sequences were cut into two parts (forward and reverse directions) at each restriction enzyme sites (REs, e.g. EcoR I). Hundreds of thousands of Read1 were mapped back to the specific regions of Ref (the specific direction of the specific RE) and clustered into several Tag1s. While hundreds or thousands of Read2, which were belonged to the same Tag1 according to the PE relationship, were gathered along a certain distance from Tag1, ranging from 150 to 800 bp in this study, and further assembled into a longer Tag2 by using CAP3 (see the box with a dashed line at the top half of Fig. b). This step is the most rate-limiting one, so multi-core CPU scripts were designed to linearly shorten the run time. Step 4 was used to constantly and continually assembly for a better result. As illustrated at bottom half of Fig. b, there is an overlap between Tag1s at forward and reverse directions of the same RE (see the box with a dashed line at the bottom half of Fig. b, AATT in this study) at large probability (around 80% in this study). These Tag1s were mixed into one sequence with the name of paired tags (pTs). Meanwhile, most of Tag1 (around 80% in this study) also has an overlap with its corresponding Tag2, so they were also assembled in a contig, and named as overlap tags (oTs). If both Tag1s of pT has an overlap with their corresponding Tag2s, a longer contig could be generated form 4 tags, including 2 Tag1s and 2 Tag2s. We defined these contigs as poTs (around 60% in this study), i.e. short for paired & overlap tags. In addition, according to the position and overlap information of all the kinds of tags, several longer contigs (defined as CpContigs) were further assembled. According to the position information of CpContigs, a scaffold (sub-super-marker) was generated, replacing the unknown bases with '-'. In total, for each sample, our pipeline would generate three 'fa' files to record the sequences of poTs, CpContigs and sub-super-marker, respectively, as well as two ¡®txt¡¯ statistical information files on the length and position of poTs and CpContigs, respectively. Finally, poTs and CpContigs / sub-super-marker could beclustered and used for further population genetic and phylogenetic studies (Fig. c).
